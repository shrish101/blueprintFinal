## Demographics and Usage

While the application provides an accessible communication platform, certain demographics might be less likely to use it. Older adults who are not familiar with technology may find the interface challenging to navigate, even with accessibility features. Additionally, users with cognitive impairments might struggle with more complex app features, such as group messaging or advanced search functions, unless more intuitive design and tutorial features are implemented. To address these issues, it would be important to continuously improve the usability and simplify the interface for all users, ensuring the program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical proficiency or age.
